This project contains my run-through of the first section of Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom. 
It is a mostly academic exercise to illustrate how to build a lexer/tokenizer, a parser, and an interpreter,
all the while learning about the fundamentals of how programming languages work at their core.
The project is all written in Java code and is incomplete at this time, but I am extremely excited
to proceed and see what I end up with. My eventual goal is to build my own compiler.
